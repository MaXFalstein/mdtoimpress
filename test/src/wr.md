## WEBRES - Web Research
* We think we know what "Web" means...
* ... but what <i>exactly</i> is "Research"
* One of those obvious things that turns out to be rather obscure when we look closer



### Research is "finding out new stuff"
* All we need to do now is decide what we mean by
    * "finding out";
    * "new"; and
    * "stuff".
* Oddly, that's easiest back to front:<ul>
    * "new" depends on the sort of stuff, and
    * "find out" depends on the kind of "newness".



### "stuff"
* Rather depends on who you are/what your objectives are... so let's pick a sample...
* ...Scientists want to know about aspects of the world/Universe around us...
* ...Engineers want to be able to build useful things ("is X possible?" "how?" or "what can we do with this new material?" or...) ...
* ...Historians and Archeologists want to know about how things <i>were</i> (perhaps to better understand the way things <i>are</i>)...
* (and many more)




#### What is "stuff"?
How can we categorise it?
* "What we know" (data)
* "What we understand" (information)
* "How to use" (techniques)
* ...



#### What is "new"?
* New to me?
* New to everyone? (= <i>new</i> new)
* Retrieving what's been lost
** Making sense of (=understanding) old data

Aside: if you spot other kinds of "new" tell me!


##### finding out new-to-me stuff
* ask someone!
* do a web-search... then double-check what you find
* do a library search<ul>
    * often directed by a web-search
    * a bit more reliable, but still double-check
* experiment/explore!




##### finding out new-to-everyone stuff
* first check what related stuff <i>is</i> known/understood (last slide)
* experiment!
* explore!





##### finding out <i>forgotten/lost</i> stuff
* depends <i>how</i> forgotten/lost
* what archeologists do all the time
* science is littered with re-discoveries, engineering with re-inventions





###### Example: The Antikythera Mechanism
[The Antikythera Mechanism](http://antikythera-mechanism.com/) (ca 87BC)

* Evidences a level of ancient knowlege of Astronomical prediction
* Knowledge lost until the 1700s



#### What is Finding Out?

* Uncertainty -> Certainty
* Belief -> Reason

##### Levels of certainty of "finding out"
* crashing around, seeing what's there/what's possible
* having a hunch that there's something there/something is possible
* having a fair certainty - but exactly what?/exactly how?
* improving on what we already have


##### An incorrect certainty...

* ...hunting to recreate fabled ancient knowledge such as...<ul>
    * the Philosopher's stone to turn lead into gold...
    * the elixir of life, to live and stay young forever...
    * and more.
* Motivated by belief without evidence
* Isaac Newton &mdash; remembered for his <i>non</i>-alchemical work
* Robert Boyle &mdash; became the first chemist
* Gave us the word "re-search" = "search again"

#### The shift from Belief to Reason

* A long slow process
* Let's have a lightening review<ul>
    * The Greeks
    * The Romans
    * (The Dark Ages)
    * Roger Bacon
    * Galileo
    * Descartes
    * the Enlightenment
* That will be horribly incomplete...


## People and Periods

### The Greeks
<img src="_webres_research_/parthenon.jpeg" align=right width=300>

* Great observational <i>thinkers</i> &mdash; best surviving records are from Athens
* Gave us most of our early Mathematics<ul>
    * but they might have got some from the Egyptians
* Developed the basics of the rules of deduction:<ul>
    * (A or B)&nbsp;&nbsp;and (not A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B
    * (A implies B)&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B
    * (A implies B)&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;(not B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not A
* Some Mechanics &mdash; <small>e.g. Antikythera from ?Corinth</small>
* But not great Engineers &mdash; "plank across supports" was the limit, even if pretty

### The Romans
* Great Conquerors, not great thinkers
* <i>Superb</i> Engineers<ul>
    * roads
    * aqueducts
    * perfected the arch
    * invented concrete

### (The Dark Ages)

* Roughly 5th to 15th centuries
* Started with the fall of the Western Roman Empire
* Much knowedge and many skills lost in the west
* Some preserved in the Eastern Roman Empire, then in the Middle East
* Some retreived when Spain was re-conquered from the Moors: also some new knowledge gained
* Started to end with the Renaissance &mdash; but that was mainly an artistic movement
* But a few high spots during that time...





## Roger Bacon c1214-1294
<img src="_webres_research_/roger-bacon-ox-statue.jpeg" align=right width=350>

* Thinker and teacher, influenced by the Greeks (especially Aristotle) and
    certain Arabic thinkers
* Coined the word "science" to mean "reliable knowledge, verifyable by
    direct observation
* E.g., despite many ancient writings mentioning gryphons and black swans, he'd
    never met anyone who'd seen either of those, so he regarded those
    reports as <i>un</i>reliable



#### Oops!

<img src="_webres_research_/black_swans_dawlish.jpeg" align=right width=350>

* Much later, when we discovered New Zealand, we found black swans there...
* [The photo is of black swans at Dawlish, Devon]
* But no-one's found a Gryphon yet
* [But now back to "after Bacon"]



### Galileo Gallilei 1564-1642
<img src="_webres_research_/galileo.jpeg" align=right width=350>
* Astronomer, Physicist, Mathematician
* Famous for the "Pisa leaning tower" experiment
* Equations describing uniform accelleration
* Invented the telescope
* Challenged geocentrism
* INVENTED the experimental method &mdash; observe, hypothesize, experimental test, repeat: that became the standard method of <i>scientific</i> "research"


### Descartes
* Many achievements, but crucially...
* ...devised the <i>method of thinking</i> we still use for complex issues:<ul>
    * break the problem up into parts, understanding the relations between the parts;
    * repeat with the parts, and the parts of parts, and so on until...
    * you have sub-sub-...parts that you can understand directly;
    * then reassemble the parts, in reverse order, understanding each reassembly as you go.

### "The Enlightenment"
<img src="_webres_research_/enlightenment-salon.jpeg" align=right width=350>

* Roughly, 18th century, Western Europe + American/Canadian East coast
* In Science, dominated by <i>evidence-based inquiry</i>, classification,
thoughtful analysis, experiment where appropriate.
* [In parallel, there was a political and philospical Enlightenment, with spin-offs such as the creation of Economics]
* Above all, <i>a value system based on thoughtful inquiry, rather than traditional beliefs



## Industry and Engineering

* Since approx 1800, all the new scientific knowledge has enabled our increasingly mechanized and (since approx 1900) electical and electonic lives
* And if anything, the pace is increasing...


# You're driving this
* We'll not impose our ideas on you: we want you free to form your own ideas.
* Since "research" means many different things, to different people, in different situations...
* ...and it oftens demands new ways of thinking...
* ...YOU define what "research" means in "Web Research"
